#
# NinjaIt Configuration File
#
# This file must reside in the same directory (folder) as the program's itself.
#
# Every line starting with "#", empty or completely blank (filled by " " only)
#will be seen as a comment.
#
# Configuration is done in <element> = <value> couples
# All elements have an hardcoded default, which is shown along with the definition
# This means you don't need to re-define defaults, if you're well with them:
#define the differences (overrides) only.
#
# e.g. Fuma key is defined as:
#
#FumaKey = "^1"
#
# (CTRL+1): if this suit your needs, leave it this way. If you need to re-define
#it, maybe as ALT+a (always use lowercase) just uncomment it's definition (by
#removing the "#" in front) and change it. You'll have to restart the program,
#to make it read the new configuration.
#
# Remember that, to define a key which uses alternate ones (CTRL, ALT or SHIFT),
#you >MUST< use AutoIt compatible symbols:
#
# CTRL = ^
# Alt = !
# SHIFT = +
# Win = #
#
# You can even use parenthesized symbols, as below:
#
# {LALT]/{RALT} = left and right Alt keys
# {LCTRL}/{RCTRL} = left and right CTRL keys
# {LSHIFT}/{RSHIFT} = left and right Shift keys
#
# See a longer list here: https://www.autoitscript.com/autoit3/docs/functions/Send.htm
