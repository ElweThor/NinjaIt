# FF_NinjaIt
Very small utility to support Ninja characters into Final Fantasy XIV

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 AutoIt Version: 3.3.14.5
 Author: Elwe Thor

 Script Function: allow to have "external macro" of Final Fantasy XIV Ninja
	ninjutsu special moves/spells.
	 As the minimum allowed Wait time, in FF, is 1 second, it's a waste of time
	to make an FF macro to cast ninjutsu (e.g. 3 whole seconds to cast Suiton).
	 As Autoit doesn't have such limitation, it can be used instead: every mudra
	element, Ten, Chi, and Jin, have a cast time of 0.5s (up to FFXIV 5.0)
