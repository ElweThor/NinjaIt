Author's note: why I forbid commercial use

 First of all, it's such a minimal, terribly small project, that I could be extremely surprised if one in the world finds a way
to make it a commercial product.
 Less rare could be to include my micro(nano?)project into other commercial ones as a feature: this is exactly what I don't like to
happen as, in Final Fantasy, "external commercial projects" usually means BOTs (cheats) programs rented for money, which are
completely against FF's ToS, they fight them, and I don't want my name associated to such things.

 Thanks for understanding
